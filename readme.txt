// INSTALLATION //
//////////////////

Additional instructions & troubleshooting tips may be found on the wiki:

http://www.subjectsplus.com/wiki/

1. Download
* Download the zip file and ftp it to the public_html or www folder of your webserver.
* Unzip. You should now have a folder called "sp".  You can rename it whatever.

2. Prepare MySQL
	a.  Fresh install:  Create a new database for subsplus, say, "sp", and a user with SELECT, INSERT,
UPDATE, ALTER and DELETE privileges. Note the name of the database, user, and user
password as you will need this information later.

	b.  Update existing install:  BACKUP YOUR DATA!!!  Save it somewhere nice.  Maybe run the updater
	on a copy of the data, rather than the original.  For the updater, your MySQL user will need SELECT, INSERT,
UPDATE, ALTER, DELETE, CREATE and DROP privileges.

3. Visit the SubjectsPlus Control Panel with your browser.

	Go to the root of the control folder (with your browser).  It will be something
	like www.mysite.edu/sp/control/ and follow the instructions

	Once you are done, you should be dropped into the login page.

4. In the Control Panel, visit admin > config site and see if anything needs tweaking.  For instance, there is now
an enlarged set of info about staff users; you might want to cut it back and/or decide which fields are required.

5.  Everything went okay?  Hooray!  Now make sure these folder permissions are okay.  (The first two probably were OK 
or else the installer would have conked out.)

/control/includes/config-default.php     --- readable by php to make config.php
/control/includes/                       --- writable by php to write config.php
/subjects/.htaccess                      --- writable by php to write .htaccess
/api/.htaccess                      	 --- writable by php to write .htaccess
/assests/users/                          --- writable by php to make new user folders

6. You will need to customize some of the Special pluslet types to match your
local environment:

control/includes/classes/sp_Pluslet_5.php -- Catalog Search Box -- localize it

7. Existing users:  It's a bummer, it's a drag, but you will need to copy over all your user files.  Go to
assets/users and haul over all the existing folders that begin with an underscore (e.g., _jsmith).  That will
bring over headshots and any uploaded images.  ALSO if you have any custom pluslets or other customizations,
you'll need to bring them over, too.  Ditto for any fresh css, especially default.css which controls the public
pages.

7.  Play around.  There is information available on the subjectsplus.com site and
the wiki (http://www.subjectsplus.com/wiki/).
