Producer's Disclaimer: It is not recommended that JCR users depend solely on citation data in their journal evaluations. Citation data are not meant to replace informed peer review. Additionally, careful attention should be paid to the many conditions that can influence citation rates, such as language, journal history and format, publication schedule, and subject specialty. The number of articles given for journals listed in the JCR include only original research and review articles. Editorials, letters, news items, and meeting abstracts are not included in article counts because they are not generally cited. Journals publishing in non-English languages or using non-Roman alphabets may be less accessible to researchers worldwide, which can influence their citation patterns. This should be taken into account in any comparative journal citation analysis.|https://iiiprxy.library.miami.edu/login?url=http://webofknowledge.com/JCR||UM Restricted|Anthropology^International Studies^Psychology|Reference^Statistics & Data||-
